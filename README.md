# **Blueprint Generator Using CNN** 🏠🖼️  
A Python-based application to create 2D and 3D blueprints of buildings using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) principles. This tool allows users to input room dimensions and visualize the layout in both 2D and 3D formats.

---

## **Features** ✨
- Generate detailed 2D and 3D blueprints for multiple floors.
- Visualize room dimensions with color-coded layouts.
- Easy-to-use interface for inputting room dimensions.
- Supports image embedding (e.g., logos) for room types in the blueprint.
- Handles complex layouts and multi-floor designs effectively.

---

## **Requirements** 📋
To use this project on your PC, ensure you have the following:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python libraries:
  - `matplotlib`
  - `plotly`
  - `os`

You can install the dependencies using the command:
```bash
pip install matplotlib plotly
```

## **Setup Instructions** ⚙️
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. Place any room-specific logos (optional) in the designated paths or adjust the `logos` variable in the code.

3. Run the script in your Python environment:
   ```bash
   python blueprint_generator.py
   ```

4. Follow the prompts to input:
   - Total land area.
   - Number of floors.
   - Room dimensions for each floor.

---

## **Using the Blueprint Generator** 🏗️
1. **Input Total Land Area**: Enter the total area in square feet.  
2. **Specify Number of Floors**: Define how many floors you want to visualize.  
3. **Enter Room Dimensions**: Provide dimensions for bedrooms, kitchens, living rooms, and bathrooms.  
   > *Ensure the total room area does not exceed the floor area.*  
4. **Visualize Layout**:
   - A 3D blueprint will display for each floor.
   - A 2D blueprint will include color-coded layouts and optional embedded logos.

---

## **Additional Notes** 📝
- Customize wall height and colors in the `draw_3d_blueprint` function for personalized designs.
- Adjust 2D blueprint settings (e.g., gridlines, axis limits) in the `draw_2d_blueprint` function.
- The tool is designed to provide an intuitive way of visualizing home designs while ensuring accuracy and flexibility.
